# Vite Plugin Legacy

Fork of official library [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy).

If you don't have issues about the official library please don't use this.

This fork fixes 

`No corresponding legacy polyfill chunk found for [chunk]`


Also has better legacy chunk naming (legacy-[name].[vendor | chunk | polyfill].[hash])
